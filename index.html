                 We believe that the beauty in the books can be part of our world. Sometimes the real world is gray and everyone needs just a little bit of magic, a small piece of this world where the time stops and everything is perfect. That can be your home and we can do this for you. So just think carefully about your favorite book, give us a copy of it and we will do our best.

                 <p>
                  Why books, not movies? Because the imagination is the most important. It is much easier to recreate something that we have already seen than to create something existing in your imagination in specific form. It is more challenging and will be personally for you.

                 <p>
                 We only live once, so we should do the best every single moment - in our work, for our family, for ourselves. Yes, we know that nobody is perfect, but everyone can do more. So, it can be ideal, maybe not today but some day.. That is why we believe that every single piece of life shoud be beautiful or just with very good design.

                  Your home should be your dream. But we have different dreams and here comes our imagination. During our years of practice we have had different projects. One of the most interesting for us was to make a small apartment to look like the school of magic (Hogwarts) in Harry Potter' s books.
